1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠   4♥   2♦   6♣   A♠   J♥   K♦   5♣   2♠ 
    5 spade and 6 spades 
    5clubs and 6 spades
2. If ther deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, K? Why or why not? 
Yes they have to be the last pairs of cards because it's impossible for there to be any left over of normal digits cards.
3.Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.  
This game both contains strategy and luck, But I feel like it's more on the luck because you never know what cards can be possibly dealt to you during the entire game.
