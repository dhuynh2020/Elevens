1. The similarties between all three of these games is that these ganes all involve a full deck of cards and a board. certain functions like deal, deckSize, isEmpty are still very similar. However the difference between these game is their isLegal and anotherPLayIsPossible. 

2. The instance variable is initazlized in the board class. Inside of the constructors of ElevensBoard, the values are passed into the constructor of the super class.

3.  They cover all the differences because all of the methods that are exactly shareable between the card games are implemented in the Board class while the overlapping functions that require diffrent implementions where anotherPlayIsPossible and isLegal are abstract, thus implementing in the respective board game subclasses.
